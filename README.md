# About The Challenge

Coding challenge submitted in April 2021 to apply for a junior developer position at [Botify](https://www.botify.com/). Following my work submission, I was invited to an interview.

IMPORTANT : As of Januaray 2022, code seems broken.... will have to figure out if it has something to do with a change in the API data and action on it.
